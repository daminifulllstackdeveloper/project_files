            <dd><u>Mike and Morris </u><i>lived in the same village. While Morris owned the largest jewelry shop in the
                    village, Mike was a poor farmer.
                    Both had large families with many sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren. <del>One fine
                        day,</del><u>Mike, </u>
                    tired of not being able to feed his family, decided to
                    leave the village and move to the city where he was certain to earn enough to feed everyone.
                    ,<mark>Along with his family, </mark> he left the village for the city.
                    <q>At night, they stopped under a large tree. </q>There was a stream running nearby where they
                    could freshen up themselves. He told his sons to clear the area below the tree, he told his wife to
                    fetch water and he instructed his daughters-in-law to make up the fire and started cutting wood from
                    the tree himself.
                    They didn't know that in the branches of the tree, there was a thief hiding. He watched as <u>Mike's
                    </u>amily worked together and also noticed that they had nothing to cook.
                    <mark>Mike's</mark>wife also thought the same and asked her husband " Everything is ready but
                    what shall we eat?".
                    <del>Mike </del>aised his hands to heaven and said " Don't worry. He is watching all of this from
                    above. He will help us." The thief got worried as he had seen that the family was large and worked
                    well together.
                    Taking advantage of the fact that they did not know he was hiding in the branches, he decided to
                    make a quick escape. He climbed down safely when they were not looking and ran for his life.</i>
